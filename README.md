Smooth Movie search, watchlist and favouriting app. Searches through movies via The Move Database (TMDB) and displays on cards. 
Clicking on the card title expands a modal with plot overview of the movie and the official rating of the movie displayed in stars.
Within the Modal are also two additional buttons, one to add the movie to your watchlist, the other to favourite the movie.

Use the header link to view your watchlist where posters of the movies you want to watch are displayed. hovering over them will show two buttons, a heart (if you want to favourite the move, and an X if you want to remove it from your watch list.

Use the other header link to view your Favourites, where, as with the watchlist, your favourite movies will be stored. hovering over the poster shows similar two buttons as the watchlist.

Your selections will be saved in localStorage.
